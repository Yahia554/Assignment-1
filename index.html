                <p> It is not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible (e.g., more easily spread from person to
                    person) compared to other variants, including Delta. The number of people testing positive has risen
                    in
                    areas of South Africa affected by this variant, but epidemiologic studies are underway to understand
                    if
                    it is because of Omicron or other factors. </p>
